    "### **Countries of Investigation**: The Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "Originally we wanted to see if there was convergence in population trends for countries who joined the EU in 2004 (mostly post-soviet states). What stood out to us most was a very similar pattern in the three Baltic states:  their populations were steadily increasing until 1994, after which they experienced a steep decline. Interested in this abnormal trend, we decided to narrow our countries of interest down to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and see what exactly caused this pattern after the fall of the USSR. Preliminary research revealed that after the USSR collapsed, these countries' healthcare systems rapidly deteriorated while poverty spiked (along with poverty, homelessness, and drug use). The combined effect was a major Tuberculosis (and HIV) epidemic around 1994. Since we only have more comprehensive data on these states starting in 1995, we decided to see how economic indicators have determined population growth and TB incidence since then. Although GDPPC is a poor measure of poverty (doesn't account for distribution), it's the most accurate indicator of poverty we have for these countries. Evidence suggests that GDPPC is strongly correlated with population, and we maintain that public health is one intermediary through which national income determines population trends.\n",
